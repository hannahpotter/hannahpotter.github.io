Inspired by a discussion I had with Ren√© around my Qualifying Evaluation talk and all the excitement around GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, I've been thinking about AI assisted programming. The interface people used to give instructions to a computer used to be punch cards. Now a standard way to give instructions to a computer is by writing out instructions in a programming language like Python. Perhaps in the future, people will mostly give instructions to a computer in natural language.

There are a lot of interesting questions to explore around AI assisted programming! In particular, I am interested in questions like:
<ul>
    <li> How can AI be used to improve reading and understanding programs and program changes?
    <li> How can we make it easier for people to understand AI suggestions?
    <li> How can we aide people in debugging AI suggestions that are close, but not quite right?
    <li> How can we support people in providing quality queries to the AI system?
