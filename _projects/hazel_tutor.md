Learning a new programming language is difficult. We are investigating ideas for programming tools to
   help experienced and novice programmers learning a new language. We have been implementing these programming tools in <a href="https://hazel.org/">Hazel</a>,
   a live functional programming environment with holes. 
   
   
   The Cursor Inspector 
   displays typing information about the expression or pattern at the cursor. The Strategy Guide is designed
   to guide novices through a type-driven development strategy. The <a href="https://hazel.org/build/strategy-guide/index.html">demo</a> for these two tools is available online. For more details about this work, check out our <a href="assets/pdf/hazeltutor-hatra2020.pdf">HATRA paper</a>!

   ExplainThis is a contextualized programming language documentation tool, which provides information about the syntactic form, an explanation, and examples for the term at the cursor. The <a href="https://hazel.org/build/explainthis/">demo</a> for ExplainThis is also available online. I collaborated with <a href="http://madadi.one/">Ardi Madadi</a> on this project.
